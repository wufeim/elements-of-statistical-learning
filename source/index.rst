About
=====================================

This is our notes for `Elements of Statistical Learning <https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/ElemStatLearn/>`_ by *Trevor Hastie*, *Robert Tibshirani*, and *Jerome Friedman*.

Even with "some" background in machine learning and statistics, my friends and I still find it hard to understand some parts of this book. Sometimes "trivial" steps are skipped; some other contents are simply hard to understand without relevant background information. This is why we are creating this notes to share our thoughts and understandings. Additional calcuations and explanations are provided and a collaborative solution manual is made.

I created an ESL study group on Douban. Come join us!

How to contribute?
=====================================

The general idea is that any comments, suggestions, or contributions are welcomed. Issues like the format of the notes or writing math equations in LaTeX should by no means be barriers to any great thinking.

1. **I'd like to add a comment/provide an exercise solution/point out a mistake.**
   
   If you are familiar with git and reStructuredText, you could submit `a pull requrest <https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/creating-an-issue-or-pull-request>`_ to the `GitHub repo of this project <https://github.com/wufeim/elements-of-statistical-learning>`_. Otherwise, opening `an issue <https://guides.github.com/features/issues/#:~:text=A%20typical%20issue%20on%20GitHub%20looks%20a%20bit,with%20access%20to%20the%20repository%20to%20provide%20feedback>`_ on GitHub would be a great idea as well.

2. **I'd like to become a collaborator of this project.**

   Usually a collaborator is more involved in this project than normal contributors. They either spend more time contributing to the notes and the solution manual or they are responsible for merging pull requests or handling the issues on GitHub. If you would like to be added as a collaborator, please send me an email or a Douban message.
