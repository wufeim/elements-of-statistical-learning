3.2 Linear Regression Models and Least Squares
=====================================

We have an input vector :math:`X^\top = (X_1, \dots, X_p)`, we want to predict a real-valued output :math:`Y`. The linear regression model has the form

.. math::

  f(X) = \beta_0 + \sum_{j=1}^p X_j\beta_j

Here :math:`X_j` can be quantitative inputs, transformations of quantitative inputs, or numerical encoding of qualitative inputs.
